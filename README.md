# Neural-nets-to-recognise-handwritten-digits
This is an attempt to demonstrate the working of neural nets to recognize handwritten digits. The inputs are 28 * 28 greyscale images of handwritten digits obtained from the MNIST dataset. It highlights the feedforward, backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.
